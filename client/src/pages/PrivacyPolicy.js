                <p>
                  Axen Holidays collects your personal data only if you provide
                  it directly to us for your request. For example, if you
                  subscribe to our weekly newsletter, you will be asked for your
                  name, email address, address, mailing address, and so on. We
                  may also use this information to compile statistics and
                  marketing strategies. When you purchase on our site, we only
                  ask for the important information needed to complete the
                  transaction process. It would also appear in the claim,
                  demand, or pre-specified request(s). When booking with Axen
                  Holidays LTD, you are invited to subscribe to our newsletter,

                  LTD would be able to establish personal contact with you to
                  help you identify issues related to your trip. This is the way
                  we personally care for our valued customers, and if you are
                  still interested in booking with us, we will work harder to
                  improve the user experience.
