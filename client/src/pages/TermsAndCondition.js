                  These terms and conditions are carefully written to provide our customers with clear and accurate information about our rights and responsibilities. We will use the terms "we" and "us" to refer to the Company, and "you" and "your" to refer to the first stated individual on the booking, as well as any other person to whom a booking is added or transferred. These terms and conditions apply to all bookings made through this website. You may not modify, copy, reproduce, or distribute any portion of these terms and conditions without prior written permission from the Company. You can also choose to book all or part of your holiday with us, depending on the nature of your choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The terms and conditions which apply to your booking depend on
                  what you have booked with us, as follows:
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Single Component Transportation Or Accommodation Bookings
                </h3>
                <p>
                  If you have booked an individual Travel Arrangement with us, for an example, a flight-only booking or a hotel-only booking we act as an agent on behalf of the third-party supplier of the flight, hotel, or another travel arrangement in question, and your contract for the Travel Arrangement you have booked will be with that Supplier/Principal. For single Travel Arrangement bookings, only Section A of these terms will apply to your booking.
                </p>

                <h3>Package Holidays</h3>
                <p>
                  Where you book a combination of flights (or alternative transport arrangements), accommodation or car hire, and the other tourist services accounting for a major proportion of the vacation, for the same trip or vacation, this may create a package for the needs of the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements regulations 2018. Axen Holidays will accept responsibility as the package organiser and your payments are going to be financially protected by us. This booking is going to be a "Package Holiday". Please see sections A and B of those Booking Conditions for the terms that apply to Package Holidays and for the total definition of what constitutes a package holiday.
                </p>

                <p>
                  All services are subject on the availability. Until tickets
                  are issued, fares are not guaranteed.
                </p>

                <h3>Online bookings: </h3>
                <p>
                  If you book online, you must give us all of the necessary information. Online bookings are processed automatically, and it is your responsibility to ensure that all of the information you provide, including but not limited to travel details, is  accurate and correctly entered online; that you select the appropriate flights, hotels, or other arrangements; and that  passenger information is entered exactly as it appears on the passport. We are not responsible for any inconsistencies in the information you supply or how it is input online. You acknowledge that any inconsistency or error in inputting information or selecting arrangements may result in additional fees that you must bear. You must also confirm that the credit or debit card you are using is your own (or, if it is a third party's, that you have their express permission to use their credit or debit card) and that you have sufficient funds to cover the cost of the arrangements you book with us. We will process your booking (subject to availability) and deduct money from you once we receive and accept it. There will be cancellation fees after this point. You will receive an e-mail confirmation and an invoice. Please double-check the details in the confirmation email and invoice as soon as possible and notify us if anything looks to be inaccurate, as modifications may not be available later. Any modifications to the booking after it has been made will incur additional costs, including supplier charges and, if required, an administration fee.
                </p>

                <h3>Telephone bookings:</h3>
                <p>
                  If you make a reservation over the phone, you must supply us with all of the necessary information. You must also ensure that all of the information you submit is correct, and that passenger information is given exactly as it appears on the passport. You must also ensure that the credit or debit card you are using is your own or, if it is a third party's, that you have their express permission to use their credit or debit card and that sufficient funds are available to cover the cost of the arrangements you book with us (subject to our acceptance). Please keep in mind that a telephone booking confirmation is just as firm as one made/confirmed in writing right away. There will be cancellation fees after this point. A confirmation, e-ticket, and invoice will be sent to you. Please verify the details on the confirmation and/or e-ticket and invoice carefully and notify us promptly if anything looks to be inaccurate, as modifications may not be feasible later. Any modifications to the booking after it has been made will incur additional costs, including supplier charges and, if required, an administration fee.
                </p>

                <h3>Payments</h3>
                <p>
                  When you make a reservation, you must pay the deposit required at the time of booking. No contract will be formed until we accept your reservation, receive your deposit or complete payment in cleared funds, and send you a confirmation invoice, either on our behalf or on behalf of the supplier in question. Please double-check that the names given match those in the passport. Please note that full payment may be required IMMEDIATELY for some telephone bookings, i.e. before you receive the confirmation invoice. If this is the case, you will be informed at the time of booking. You must pay your balances on time because failure to do so may result in the cancellation of your vacation/flights, leaving you liable for cancellation fees. If there is a "booking fee," it will have been disclosed at the time of booking. The price of your booking may increase until full payment is collected as a result of fuel or other surcharges imposed by suppliers. Please note that we do not accept responsibility for cash sent by courier or post, even if it is sent via registered or documented delivery or any other special delivery method.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Data Protection Policy</h3>
                <p>
                  In order to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your requirements, we need to use the information you provide. We'll need information like your name and address, special needs, dietary restrictions, and so on to make sure your vacation works smoothly. We will protect this information with acceptable security methods. However, we must share it with your travel plans' vendors, such as airlines, hotels, and transportation firms. We may also give it to security or credit-checking businesses, as well as government agencies like customs and immigration. {" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please see our Privacy Policy here for further information.
                </p>

                <h3>4.Passports, Visa and Health Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                  Consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for information on passports and visas. Requirements are subject to change, so verify the most recent status before booking or departing. We will not be held liable if you are denied entrance onto a flight or into any country because you did not have the requisite passport, visa, or other documents required by any airline, authority, or country. Your passport must be, at least 6 months valid, ahead of the return date. You must ensure that you have the correct visa and health entrance requirements for any countries you visit, even if you are only passing through. Even if you do not exit the aircraft or the airport, this includes all stops made by the aircraft. The flight carrier(s) and timing(s) shown on our website and in your email are subject to modification and confirmation. The following information will be supplied no later than two weeks before travel. This is to avoid any last-minute changes (by airlines, governments, and authorities) in the event of unanticipated situations, which could result in cancellation fees or refund delays. Make sure you have a look at www.gov.uk to check the latest travel advice for the destination you are visiting. The Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) is the best and most up-to-date source of travel advice. It issues essential travel advice for worldwide destinations, which includes information on entry requirements including passports and visas, as well as health, safety and security, local laws, and more. The travel advice may change and you should continue to check it until you commence your travel.
                </p>

                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p>
                  Recommended vaccinations for travel may change at any time and you should consult your doctor on current recommendations before you travel. As per (FCDO) advice, you should visit your health professional at least around 5 weeks before your trip to check whether you need any vaccinations or other preventive measures. Country-specific information and advice are published by the National Travel Health Network and Centre on the Travel Health Pro website and by NHS (Scotland) on the fit for a travel website. {" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is your responsibility to ensure that you obtain the recommended vaccinations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice about your trip. We will not accept any accountability if you cannot travel, or incur any other loss because you have not complied with any passport, visa, immigration requirements, or health formalities. You also agree to reimburse us for any fines or other losses which we incur as a result of your failure to comply with any passport, visa, immigration requirements, or health formalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For more information on avoiding health risks, planning for healthy traveling, and obtaining emergency medical treatment, visit the NHS website.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Special Requests and Medical Problems</h3>
                <p>
                  Please let us know if you have any specific preferences when making your reservation. We are not a specialist disabled  holiday company, but we will do our best to pass on any such requests to the appropriate supplier(s) but we cannot guarantee that they will be fulfilled. The fact that a particular request as indicated on your confirmation invoice or any other documentation, it was forwarded to the supplier(s), does not mean that it will be fulfilled. We will not be in violation of the contract if we fail to meet any particular requests. We do not accept reservations that are conditional on particular requests being fulfilled. Unfortunately, most of the overseas destinations do not have the basic facilities required by disabled travelers. We might require you, to produce evidence, a doctor's certificate certifying that you are fit to participate. Acting reasonably, if we are unable to properly accommodate the needs of the person(s) concerned, we will not confirm your booking or if you did not give us full details at the time of booking, we will cancel it and impose applicable cancellation charges when we become aware of these details.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Travel Insurance</h3>
                <p>
                  Axen Holidays strongly recommends passengers take out Travel Insurance that adequately covers all their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please note: It is your responsibility to ensure that you have adequate insurance coverage. We recommend that you have travel insurance that covers medical expenses and cancellation as a bare minimum. Certain destinations have specific requirements; for more information, consult your travel itinerary and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                <p>
                  We make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our work, but as soon as you receive it, please carefully check all the details and let us know immediately if there are any discrepancies. The name(s) on all travel documents must exactly match the name(s) on the passport(s). If you are getting married or changing your name in the passport(s), this must be reflected in your travel document. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in change fees and flight cancellations.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  9. Flights and Flight Travel Documents
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Please note that flights marked as "direct flights" on your ticket are not necessarily non-stop. All departure/arrival times for flight tickets are provided by the relevant airlines and are estimates. These are subject to change due to air traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, operational / maintenance requirements, and the obligation to check-in passengers on time. If you are late, we cannot make any special arrangements. These matters/affairs are at the sole discretion of the airline concerned. Please note that if you do not use the flight schedule sector without contacting the airline directly, all remaining sectors may be canceled without notice, by the airline. In cases such as this, we will not be responsible for any costs incurred.
                </p>

                <h3>10. Reconfirming all Flights</h3>
                <p>
                  You must reconfirm your flight tickets, timings, and check-in details with the airline involved at least 72 hours before departure when arriving at any destination or stopover location. This is also true for your first flight from the United  Kingdom. This action allows the airline to contact you in the event of any unexpected delays or changes to your itinerary, as well as provide the airline with your contact information.
                </p>

                <h3>11. Routing and Timings</h3>
                <p>
                  The routing of your ticket cannot be modified once the balance has been paid. Please keep in mind that departure times by air, sea, road, or rail are simply approximations. If there are operational challenges, weather circumstances, or passenger issues, such as failure to check in on time, these times may change. Because airline procedures may cause flight times to vary, your final itinerary will include the most up-to-date information. Please be aware that carriers have carriage conditions that will apply to you and limit or exclude liability. The relevant airline's website has copies available. Axen Holidays do not make arrangements in the event of an airline delay, disrupting any part of the outbound or inbound of your flight. The majority of the airline, however, do make provisions for such instances.
                </p>

                <h4>Changes & Cancellation By You</h4>
                <p>
                  Any cancellation or alteration request must be made in writing and addressed to cs@axenholidays.com using the email address registered with us at the time of booking. Before traveling, make sure you have written confirmation of any changes to your reservation. While we will make every effort to help, we cannot promise that such requests will be fulfilled. Amendments and cancellations are only permitted by the Supplier/Principal of your Arrangements' booking rules. The Supplier/Principal may charge the cancellation or alteration fees specified in their booking restrictions (which might be up to 100% of the Arrangements cost) and will normally increase closer to the date of departure). In addition, you will pay an administration fee of £50 per person per booking plus any Amendment fees/charges that are always non-refundable and will be applied to your invoice.
                </p>
                <h4>Air Ticket Refund</h4>
                <p>
                  This is where you want to cancel your entire flights/holiday plan, or just a section of them. Any cancellation requests must be submitted in writing by the person who made the booking, through the registered email id. Air tickets returned for a refund are subject to an administration fee, per ticket, regardless of the number of tickets returned, and you will be required to pay a per-ticket cancellation fee levied by the airline or consolidator as per their terms and conditions. There is no automatic right to a refund. Many airline tickets are paid in full at the time of purchase, and unless otherwise stated, they are non-refundable, non-changeable, and non-re-routable in the event of cancellation. Some vendors (especially airlines) may treat a name change as a cancellation and will not return any cash. The airline will immediately cancel the return sector if an outgoing component of your flight coupon is not utilised, and there is no automatic recourse to a refund for such partially used tickets. All other partially used tickets are usually non-refundable. In addition, you will pay an administration fee of £50 per person per booking. In the case of airline ticket refunds, it usually takes around 4 to 6 weeks to get the funds back, from the time the tickets are submitted to the airline for consideration and in some extraordinary circumstances up to three months. In most cases, Axen Holidays is not permitted to issue a refund without first consulting with the airline.
                </p>
                <p>Most of the supplier does not allow name changes and therefore full cancellation charges will apply.</p>
                <p>If the cause for cancellation is covered by your insurance coverage (if you have any), you may be able to recoup these costs through the insurance company.</p>

                <h3>12. Administration fee</h3>
                <p>
                  WWhere your request for change/cancellation can be met, you must pay all costs and charges incurred or imposed by the Supplier along with a fee of £50 per person. {" "}
                </p>

                <h3>13. Flight Changes (Cancellation separately?)</h3>
                <p>
                  We will try to help you make modifications to your arrangements after they have been confirmed, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so, such changes are subject to availability and where permitted by the carrier. Amendment costs vary by Supplier, so you'll need to talk to us to figure out how much it'll cost you based on the type of modification you want to make and you will be charged an admin fee per person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tickets are non-transferable and the airlines practically will never allow a full name change and almost always impose 100% cancellation fees. Amendment fees are always non-refundable and will be applied to your invoice. Any additional charges that airlines or suppliers pass on to us will be applied to your bill. We will always do our best to comply with new directions, but only after receiving them in writing.
                </p>

                <h3>14. Cancellation</h3>
                <p>
                  This is where you want to cancel your entire flights/holiday plan, or just a section of them. Any cancellation requests must be submitted in writing by the person who made the booking, through the registered email id. Before the balance is paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All funds paid will be forfeited if your entire travel plan is canceled. If a part of your vacation is canceled, you will be charged an admin fee per person. Where additional funds were paid for a specific component, these funds will be forfeited.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of our flights are subject to unique terms and conditions, which might include cancellation fees of up to 100%. These fees will be added to the charges listed above. The airline or operator's cancellation fees, as well as Axen Holidays'  cancellation fees will be imposed on or after departure. Even if a given element is used whole or partially, it can result in the loss of all money paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that if your insurance coverage covers the cause for cancellation (if you have any), you may be able to recoup these costs through the insurance company. Before the cancellation is finalized, you will be informed of the precise amount.
                </p>

                <h3>15. Refunds</h3>
                <p>
                  Air tickets returned for a refund are subject to an administration fee, per ticket, regardless of the number of tickets  returned, and you will be required to pay a per-ticket cancellation fee levied by the airline or consolidator as per their terms and conditions. There is no automatic right to a refund, and when you return an air ticket to us, we will  have it forward to the relevant airline or consolidator to determine eligibility for a possible refund as per the terms and conditions of the relevant airline or consolidator. If a recoverable air ticket refund is less than the  administration fee, the ticket is considered fully non-refundable. Any non-refundable ticket for which a tax refund  application is made by us at your request and on your behalf will be charged an administration fee per ticket. If the  recoverable tax components of your ticket are less than the administration charge, your ticket will be considered fully non-refundable. Refunds (s) will not be issued to you until we receive them from the relevant airline or consolidator. In the case of airline ticket refunds, this usually takes around 4 to 6 weeks from the time the tickets are submitted to the airline for consideration and in some extraordinary circumstances up to three months to receive the funds back. In most cases, Axen Holidays is not permitted to issue a refund without first consulting with the airline.
                </p>

                <h3>Changes or Cancellations by the Supplier/Principal</h3>
                <p>
                  Any changes or cancellations will be communicated to you as soon as feasible. If the Supplier/Principal offers you alternate arrangements or a refund, you must notify us within the time frame we provide. If you do not, the Supplier/Principal has the right to infer that you want a refund. We are not responsible for any changes or cancellations to your arrangements made by the Supplier/Principal as a result of your contract with them.
                </p>

                <h3>16. Event of Force Majeure</h3>
                <p>
                  This means you will not be entitled to a full refund, and we will not compensate you if we are forced to cancel or change  your travel arrangements due to unusual or unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control. This includes, but is not limited to, war, riot, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, and its consequences, natural or nuclear disaster (such as volcanic ash), fire, adverse weather conditions, and unavoidable technical problems with transportation. Normal cancellation fees will be applied.
                </p>

                <h3>17. No cooling off period</h3>
                <p>
                  Please note that you do not have the legal right to change your mind and cancel your travel arrangements and receive a refund within 14 days. This right under the 2013 Consumer Contract Regulation does not apply to travel arrangements or packaged vacations.
                </p>

                <h3>18. Telephone Calls</h3>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right to record telephone conversations for quality assurance and training purposes so that customer service is constantly reviewed.
                </p>

                <h3>19. Complaints Procedure</h3>
                <p>
                  If you have a formal complaint or claim that you wish to pursue, please write to us complaint@axenholidays.com {" "}
                </p>

                <h3>20. Your Financial Protection</h3>
                <p>
                  You will obtain an ATOL Certificate when you purchase an ATOL-protected flight or flight includes package from us. This  section outlines the financial protection offered, as well as where you may receive further information and who to contact if something goes wrong. The services indicated on the ATOL Certificate will be provided by us/suppliers (or a suitable alternative). If we or the supplier are unable to do so due to insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may be able to offer you the services you have purchased, or an acceptable alternative (at no extra cost). You agree to accept that the alternative ATOL holder will fulfill those duties in those situations, and you agree to pay any outstanding money due under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you acknowledge that in some situations, appointing an alternative ATOL holder will be impossible, in which case you will be entitled to file an ATOL claim (or your credit card issuer where applicable). The Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or bestow a benefit on) you if we/suppliers indicated on your ATOL certificate are unable to offer the services mentioned (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) due to insolvency, under the ATOL scheme.
